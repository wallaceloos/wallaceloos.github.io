 <p align="justify">I am a Machine Learning Researcher at CIPAC, University of Calgary. I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Calgary, and I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Goias (PUC-GO) and my MSc and PhD in Electrical Engineering from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). I have been working with segmentation and classification of medical images using deep learning models. My research interests include: Foundation Model for Healthcare, Language Large Models, and Self-Supervised Learning.
