 <p align="justify">I am a Machine Learning Researcher at CIPAC, University of Calgary. I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Calgary, Canada, and received my  bachelor degree in Computer Science from Pontifical Catholic University of Goias (PUC-GO) and my  MSc and PhD in Electrical Engineering from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). I have  been working on segmentation and classification deep learning  models on medical imaging. My current research interests include Foundation Model for Healthcare, Language Large Models and Self-Supervised Learning.
